                                    Apollo gave his son Orpheus a lyre and taught him how to play.
                                    It had been said that “nothing could resist Orpheus’s
                                    beautiful melodies, neither enemies nor beasts.” Orpheus fell
                                    in love with Eurydice, a woman of beauty and grace, whom he
                                    married and lived happily with for a short time. However, when
                                    Hymen had been called to bless the marriage, he predicted that
                                    their perfection was not meant to last.

                                    A short time after this prophecy, Eurydice had been wandering
                                    in the forest with the Nymphs. In some versions of the story,
                                    Aristaeus, a shepherd, then saw her, was beguiled by her
                                    beauty, made advances towards her and began to chase her.
                                    Other versions of the story relate that Eurydice is merely
                                    dancing with the Nymphs. In any case, while fleeing or
                                    dancing, she was bitten by a snake and died instantly.{" "}
